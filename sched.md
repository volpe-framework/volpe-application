## Problem metadata

- enter memory cap for 1 container
- fixed popln size
- target number of islands needed

## Problem should include 

algorithm:
essentially a packing problem

assign problems in highest memory to lowest memory, 1 per device till cap is met

## Formulation

p_i - memory needed for problem i
n_i - target instances for container i
m_j - 


# Tasks

0. fix problem store
1. add problem metadata
2. remove problem
3. add scheduler
